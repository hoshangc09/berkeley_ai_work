Insights and Analysis

Welcome to my repository, where I've embarked on an adventurous journey into the depths of data analysis. This project is all about diving into the vast ocean of data, surfing through waves of cleaning, categorizing, and shaping our dataset into pristine insights. Join me as I navigate the fascinating world of data detective work.

Project Overview
In this project, we've examined various aspects of consumer behavior, particularly focusing on coupon usage. Our investigation led us to interesting findings about preferences and tendencies among different demographic groups. 

Key Highlights

Coffee House Coupons: A significant preference for coffee house coupons among the Seattle crowd.

Temperature Data: Initially considered but later excluded due to its insignificance.

Coupon Usage Patterns: Uncovered that people without urgent destinations are more likely to use coupons.

Bar Scene Analysis: An in-depth look into the bar coupon acceptance, influenced by factors like presence of children and social status.

Carry-Away Coupons: A surprising twist in the tale with a gender tilt in acceptance rates.

Demographic Insights: A deep dive into age, income, occupation, and other demographic factors influencing coupon use.
